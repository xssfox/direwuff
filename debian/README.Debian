In order to start direwuff as a service the configuration file
/etc/direwuff.conf needs to exist. Otherwise attempting to start the service
returns an 'Assertion failed' error. An example configuration file which may be
used as a model can be found in
/usr/share/doc/direwuff/examples/direwuff.conf.gz
