 * Module:      dns_sd_common.c
 *
 * Purpose:   	Announce the KISS over TCP service using DNS-SD, common functions
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *     Most people have typed in enough IP addresses and ports by now, and
 *     would rather just select an available TNC that is automatically
 *     discovered on the local network.  Even more so on a mobile device
 *     such an Android or iOS phone or tablet.
 *
 *     This module contains common functions needed on Linux and MacOS.
