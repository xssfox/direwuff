 *
 * Module:      audio_stats.c
 *
 * Purpose:   	Print statistics for audio input stream.
 *
 * 		A common complaint is that there is no indication of 
 *		audio input level until a packet is received correctly.
 *		That's true for the Windows version but the Linux version
 *		prints something like this each 100 seconds:
 *
 *		ADEVICE0: Sample rate approx. 44.1 k, 0 errors, receive audio level CH0 73
 *
 *		Some complain about the clutter but it has been a useful
 *		troubleshooting tool.  In the earlier RPi days, the sample
 *		rate was quite low due to a device driver issue.  
 *		Using a USB hub on the RPi also caused audio problems.
 *		One adapter, that I tried, produces samples at the 
 *		right rate but all the samples are 0.
 *
 *		Here we pull the code out of the Linux version of audio.c
 *		so we have a common function for all the platforms.
 *
 *		We also add a command line option to adjust the time
 *		between reports or turn them off entirely.
 *		
 * Revisions: 	This is new in version 1.3.
