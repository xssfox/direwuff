 *
 * Name:	cdigipeater.c
 *
 * Purpose:	Act as an digital repeater for connected AX.25 mode.
 *		Similar digipeater.c is for APRS.
 *
 *
 * Description:	Decide whether the specified packet should
 *		be digipeated.  Put my callsign in the digipeater field used.
 *
 *		APRS and connected mode were two split into two
 *		separate files.  Yes, there is duplicate code but they
 *		are significantly different and I thought it would be
 *		too confusing to munge them together.
 *
 * References:	The Ax.25 protocol barely mentions digipeaters and
 *		and doesn't describe how they should work.

 * Name:	cdigipeat_match
 * 
 * Purpose:	A simple digipeater for connected mode AX.25.
 *
 * Input:	pp		- Pointer to a packet object.
 *	
 *		mycall_rec	- Call of my station, with optional SSID,
 *				  associated with the radio channel where the 
 *				  packet was received.
 *
 *		mycall_xmit	- Call of my station, with optional SSID,
 *				  associated with the radio channel where the 
 *				  packet is to be transmitted.  Could be the same as
 *				  mycall_rec or different.
 *
 *		has_alias	- True if we have an alias.
 *
 *		alias		- Optional compiled pattern for my station aliases.
 *				  Do NOT attempt to use this if 'has_alias' is false.
 *
 *		to_chan		- Channel number that we are transmitting to.
 *
 *		cfilter_str	- Filter expression string for the from/to channel pair or NULL.
 *				  Note that only a subset of the APRS filters are applicable here.
 *		
 * Returns:	Packet object for transmission or NULL.
 *		The original packet is not modified.  The caller is responsible for freeing it.
 *		We make a copy and return that modified copy!
 *		This is very important because we could digipeat from one channel to many.
 *
 * Description:	The packet will be digipeated if the next unused digipeater
 *		field matches one of the following:
 *
 *			- mycall_rec
 *			- alias list
 *
 *		APRS digipeating drops duplicates within 30 seconds but we don't do that here.
