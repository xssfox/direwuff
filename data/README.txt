tocalls.yaml contains the encoding for the device/system/software
identifier which created the packet.
Knowing what generated the packet is very useful for troubleshooting.
TNCs, digipeaters, and IGates must not change this. 

For MIC-E format, well... it's complicated.
See  Understanding-APRS-Packets.pdf.   Too long to repeat here.

For all other packet types, the AX.25 destination, or "tocall" field
contains a code for what generated the packet.
This is of the form AP????.    For example, APDW18 for direwuff 1.8.

The database of identifiers is currently maintained by Hessu, OH7LZB.
